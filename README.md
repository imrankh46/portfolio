## Introduction

Welcome to my machine learning portfolio! I have learned and implemented various machine learning algorithms and techniques, and this repository showcases some of my most interesting projects. The projects cover a wide range of topics, from supervised learning classification tasks to more advanced natural language processing projects.

## Projects

### 1. Supervised Learning

#### Breast Cancer Classification
- Description: Binary classification of breast cancer diagnosis (benign or malignant) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

### 2. Natural Language Processing

#### Sentiment Analysis using Twitter Data
- Description: Sentiment analysis of tweets to classify their emotional polarity (positive, negative, neutral).
- Algorithms: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and Naive Bayes classifier.

## Datasets

- [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- [Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140)

## Installation

To run the projects, you need Python 3 and the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required dependencies using pip:


## Usage

Each project is organized in its respective folder, containing the dataset, Python scripts, and Jupyter Notebooks. You can navigate to each project's folder to find detailed instructions on running the code.

## Results

The performance metrics and evaluation results for each model in the projects are documented in their respective README files.

## Visualization
