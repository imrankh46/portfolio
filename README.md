# Introduction

As a fresh graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a strong understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP), I have worked on several NLP projects, including text generation, text summarization, classification, and fine-tuning large language models. I have also conducted research for my final year project on Pashto poetry generation using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), which resulted in two papers: "Pashto Poetry Generation using ML and DL" and "Pashto Poetry Dataset for Deep Learning". Currently, both papers are under review.
